# MD IO
This repo is a public feature and issue tracker for MD IO, a typeface currently under development and available through [Future Fonts](https://www.futurefonts.xyz/mass-driver/io). Upcoming changes, bug reports, feature requests and issues are centrally documented and tracked through this repo.

If you have a request for a new feature (such as support for a particular character [set] or a new OpenType feature), or if you discover a visual or technical issue, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mass-driver/md-io/issues). I canâ€™t guarantee every suggestion will be implemented, however I will try to fix any technical issue (within reason).
